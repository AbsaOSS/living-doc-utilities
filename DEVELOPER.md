## Project Setup

If you need to set up the project locally, follow these steps:

### Prepare the Environment

```shell
python3 --version
```

### Set Up Python Environment

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Pylint Check Locally

This project uses the [Pylint](https://pypi.org/project/pylint/) tool for static code analysis.
Pylint analyses your code without actually running it.
It checks for errors, enforces coding standards, looks for code smells, etc.
We do exclude the `tests/` file from the Pylint check.

Pylint displays a global evaluation score for the code, rated out of a maximum score of 10.0.
We are aiming to keep our code quality high above the score 9.5.

Follow these steps to run Pylint check locally:

- Perform the [setup of python venv](#set-up-python-environment).

### Run Pylint

Run Pylint on all files that are currently tracked by Git in the project.
```shell
pylint $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

To run Pylint on a specific file, follow the pattern `pylint <path_to_file>/<name_of_file>.py`.

Example:
```shell
pylint src/living_doc_utilities/inputs/action_inputs.py
``` 

### Expected Output

This is an example of the expected console output after running the tool:
```bash
************* Module main
main.py:30:0: C0116: Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)

------------------------------------------------------------------
Your code has been rated at 9.41/10 (previous run: 8.82/10, +0.59)
```

## Run Black Tool Locally

This project uses the [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) tool for code formatting.
Black aims for consistency, generality, readability and reducing git diffs.
The coding style used can be viewed as a strict subset of PEP 8.

The root project file `pyproject.toml` defines the Black tool configuration.
In this project we are accept a line length of 120 characters.
We also exclude the `tests/` files from black formatting.

Follow these steps to format your code with Black locally:

- Perform the [setup of python venv](#set-up-python-environment).

### Run Black

Run Black on all files that are currently tracked by Git in the project.
```shell
black $(git ls-files '*.py')
```

To run Black on a specific file, follow the pattern `black <path_to_file>/<name_of_file>.py`.

Example:
```shell
black ./src/living_doc_utilities/inputs/action_inputs.py 
``` 

### Expected Output

This is an example of the expected console output after running the tool:
```
All done! ‚ú® üç∞ ‚ú®
1 file reformatted.
```

## Run mypy Tool Locally

This project uses the [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) 
tool which is a static type checker for Python.

> Type checkers help ensure that you‚Äôre using variables and functions in your code correctly.
> With mypy, add type hints (PEP 484) to your Python programs, 
> and mypy will warn you when you use those types incorrectly.

The my[py] configuration is in the `pyproject.toml` file.
Follow these steps to run my[py] locally:

### Run my[py]

Run my[py] on all files in the project.
```shell
  mypy .
```

To run my[py] check on a specific file, follow the pattern `mypy <path_to_file>/<name_of_file>.py --check-untyped-defs`.

Example:
```shell
   mypy living_doc_utilities/decorators.py
``` 

### Expected Output

This is an example of the expected console output after running the tool:
```
Success: no issues found in 1 source file
```

---


## Run Unit Test

Unit tests are written using the Pytest framework. To run all the tests, use the following command:
```shell
pytest tests/
```

You can modify the directory to control the level of detail or granularity as per your needs.

To run a specific test, run the command following the pattern below:
```shell
pytest tests/utils/test_utils.py::test_make_issue_key
```

---
## Code Coverage

This project uses the [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) plugin to generate test coverage reports.
The objective of the project is to achieve a minimum score of 80 %. We do exclude the `tests/` file from the coverage report.

To generate the coverage report, run the following command:
```shell
pytest --cov=. tests/ --cov-fail-under=80 --cov-report=html
```

See the coverage report on the path:

```shell
open htmlcov/index.html
```

## How to Release

All releases are handled entirely through GitHub Actions via a manual dispatch ‚Äî no local tagging or manual PyPI upload is required.

### üîÅ Steps to Release

1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
version = "0.1.1"
```

2. Commit the change (use IDE or command line):

```bash
git commit -am "Release v0.1.1"
git push origin main
```

3. Trigger the release workflow:
   - Go to your repository **‚Üí Actions**
   - Select **"Release - Build & Publish"**
   - Click **"Run workflow"**
   - Fill in the inputs:
     - `tag-name`: `v0.1.1` ‚Üê this must match the version in pyproject.toml
     - `from-tag-name` (optional): a previous tag like `v0.1.0`
       - This is used to generate changelog entries **only for changes** since that tag. If omitted, the most recent existing tag will be used automatically.


4. The workflow will:
   - Validate the version tag format
   - Generate structured release notes
   - Create and push a Git tag for the current commit
   - Build the Python package
   - Upload the package to PyPI
   - Create a draft GitHub release using the generated changelog


5. Review and publish the draft release:
   - Go to your repository **‚Üí Releases**
   - Click the newly created Draft release for v0.1.1
   - Make any final edits (if needed)
   - Click **‚ÄúPublish release‚Äù** to make it public
